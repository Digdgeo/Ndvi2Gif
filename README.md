**Ndvi2Gif** is a Python library designed to simplify access to global satellite data through the Google Earth Engine platform. While its name highlights the ability to create seasonal GIF animations, the true power of this tool lies in its capability to compute and export pixel-wise statistics for any regioque aun hace gifs
n on Earth, across any time span covered by supported remote sensing datasets.

Built on top of [Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api) and [Geemap](https://github.com/giswqs/geemap), it allows you to:

- Generate annual or multi-annual composited rasters (e.g., median NDVI per season between 2001 and 2020),
- Apply multiple statistics (mean, max, percentiles) across space and time,
- Export results as GeoTIFFs for further analysis,
- Retrieve zonal statistics over user-defined geometries,
- And yes ‚Äî also create colorful GIFs for easy visualization.

Whether you're monitoring crop phenology, assessing drought trends, or preparing input layers for further ecological modeling, `ndvi2gif` makes it easier to extract reliable, multi-temporal remote sensing information at scale.

Ndvi2Gif was updated and extended as part of its integration into the eLTER and SUMHAL projects, which also enabled the use of eLTER site boundaries (via `deimsPy`) as one of its input sources.

## Why use Ndvi2Gif?

Unlike many visualization-oriented tools, Ndvi2Gif is designed as a **remote sensing analytics helper** that abstracts much of the complexity of working directly with Google Earth Engine.

You can:

- **Access pixel-wise statistics** over any Earth location, at any scale and time span.
  - Example: *Obtain the monthly median of the 95th NDVI percentile per pixel from 1984 to 2024 using Landsat data.*
  - Example: *Calculate the maximum of the seasonal NDWI maximums between 2017 and 2023 using Sentinel-2.*
- **Perform nested aggregations**:
  - First compute temporal summaries (e.g., per-season percentiles or means), then apply a second statistical reduction across years (e.g., median, min, max).
- **Target any ecological or phenological metric** by choosing the appropriate index and statistical pipeline.
- **Work globally**, without needing to download or preprocess raw satellite data ‚Äî all computations are handled via Earth Engine's cloud infrastructure.

In other words: if you can describe a temporal range, a spatial region, an index, and a chain of statistics ‚Äî `ndvi2gif` can likely generate it.

Yes, it makes nice GIFs ‚Äî but it‚Äôs much more than that.

## Supported Datasets

**Sentinel:**

- [Sentinel 1 (SAR)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S1_GRD)
- [Sentinel 2 (TOA)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2_HARMONIZED)

**Landsat:**

- [Landsat 4 TM](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LT04_C02_T1_L2)
- [Landsat 5 TM](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LT05_C02_T1_L2)

- [Landsat 9 OLI](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC09_C02_T1_L2)

**MODIS:**

- [MOD09A1 (SR)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MOD09A1)

You can combine any of the supported indices, datasets, and statistical methods. By default, the tool uses NDVI with the **maximum** statistic to avoid cloud contamination. However, **median** and **percentile 90** are often visually better for Landsat datasets.

Note: Sentinel-2 uses **TOA reflectance** (Surface Reflectance is only available since 2017), while Landsat and MODIS collections use **Surface Reflectance (SR)**.

The tool generates rasters with 4 (seasons), 12 (months), or 24 (custom periods) bands per year.

Beyond creating a nice-looking animated GIF, this multi-seasonal compositing method provides insights into vegetation dynamics, phenology, land cover, and more. High values in all seasons (white tones) typically mean perennial vegetation, while low values (dark tones) might represent water, soil, or impervious surfaces.

With SAR (Sentinel-1) support added, the tool now enables structural monitoring of vegetation using radar backscatter intensity.

## GeoTIFF Export

You can also export seasonal NDVI composites as GeoTIFF files for further analysis. Multi-year composites are supported as well. For example, you can export median NDVI per season for all of Africa between 2001‚Äì2020.
