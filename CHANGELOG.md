## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-17

### Added

- **New SAR Indices**: RVI (Radar Vegetation Index), VV/VH ratio, VH, VV, DPSVI for Sentinel-1
- **Flexible Percentiles**: Support for any percentile value (1-99) instead of fixed 90/95
- **Enhanced Sentinel-1**: VV+VH dual polarization with speckle filtering
- **Robust ROI Handling**: Support for drawn features, lists of features, and improved geometry conversion
- **Incomplete Year Support**: Automatic detection and processing of available periods for current/incomplete years
- **Enhanced Dependencies**: Added pycrs and deims as core dependencies (now available in conda)
- **Example Notebooks**: Comprehensive examples in `examples_notebooks/` folder

### Fixed

- ROI conversion for drawn geometries and feature lists from geemap
- Speckle filter now preserves temporal properties (system:time_start)
- Band naming consistency for SAR indices
- Error handling for missing data periods
- Dependency issues with pycrs and deims

### Improved

- More robust error handling throughout the library
- Better documentation and examples
- Enhanced support for agricultural monitoring workflows
- Simplified installation process

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added

- **Dynamic period generation**: Support for any number of temporal periods (4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 52, or any custom number).
- **Flexible temporal analysis**: Easy configuration from traditional 4 seasons to 52 weekly periods or any custom division.
- **Enhanced extensibility**: Adding new satellites and datasets is now trivial with the unified architecture.

### Changed

- **Major code refactoring**: Eliminated over 90% of code duplication by replacing 40+ individual period functions with a single dynamic system.
- **Improved maintainability**: Reduced codebase from ~3,000 lines to ~400 lines while maintaining all functionality.
- **Enhanced performance**: Streamlined period generation and composite creation.

### Technical Details

- Replaced hardcoded period definitions with dynamic `_generate_periods()` method.
- Consolidated all `get_winter()`, `get_january()`, `get_p1()` through `get_p24()` functions into a single `get_period_composite()` method.
- Maintained full backward compatibility - all existing code works without changes.
- Added comprehensive leap year handling to prevent date-related errors.

### Breaking Changes

- None - this release maintains 100% backward compatibility.
